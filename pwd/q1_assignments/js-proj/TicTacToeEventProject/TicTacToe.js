    //Extra Idea Goals for a challenge (not graded or required) :
    //1) try and change the style of all the divs that contain the 
    //   winning X's or O's.
    //
    // 2) Use an image (by changing its source) instead of placing text 
    //    X or text O in the div contents.  Make sure the img's css 
    //    style rules make it fit appropriately inside the div
    //
    // 3) change game to play SOS and keep track of scores for two 
    //    players
    //
    // 4) Reset game to play again after someone wins.  Alternate who
    //    starts (X or O). 
    //
    // 5) Create an algorithm that plays as the computer.
